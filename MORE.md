# About funblog

This is a simple blog software written in Haskell to demonstrate how to
use the web framework [Spock](http://github.com/agrafix/Spock). It
(will) provide(s) examples for:

* Routing
* Using template engines
* Writing a REST API (JSON)
* Working with Forms
* Using a database
* Session management
* Background-Workers
* Authentication
* Spock Contexts

This repository also provided the material for my talk at
[BobKonf 2015 Berlin](http://bobkonf.de/2015/thiemann.html) (German).

# Quickstart

1. Clone the github repository
2. Run `stack install`
3. Adjust `blog.cfg`

Please not that this software is NOT intendet to be used in production (yet?).
